# Hangman - Project
Second python project completed for AiCore skills bootcamp 

October 2023

## Summary 
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word from a selected list of fruits and the user tries to guess it within a given number of turns.  

This project has been a fun way to get to grips with python, exposing me to a range of fundimental techniques and features to ensure a solid foundation and build transferable skills. Such as implementing and following object oriented programming practicies.
